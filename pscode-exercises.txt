// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

(Your pseudocode here)

Calculate sum=num1+num2



// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

(Your pseudocode here)

take Number
remainder=Number%2
if remainder==0;
   print even
else
   print odd

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

(Your pseudocode here)

a) n1, n2, n3, n4, n5
b) avg = (n1+n2+n3+n4+n5)/5
c) n1 = small - n1 = large
if n1 > ni then:
small = ni
if n1 < ni: then:
large = ni
d) print avg
print small
print large
